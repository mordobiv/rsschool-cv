## Info:

I prefer interesting and challenging tasks. That's why I would like to become a JavaScript Software Engineer - because this sphere fascinates me. It's diversity - from FrontEnd to BackEnd, wonderful, and friendly community and thousands another things. 
I have some experience in another IT sphere (QA), but I have always been inclined to do more technical stuff - from autotests to some 500+ lines bash scripts. So here I am!
